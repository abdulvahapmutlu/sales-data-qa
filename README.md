# sales-data-qa
This project demonstrates a retrieval-augmented question-answering (QA) system for sales data stored in Excel files. The system combines ChromaDB for efficient document retrieval, HuggingFace embeddings for text encoding, and GPT-J-6B for natural language responses. This setup allows users to query data in English and receive context-aware answers.
